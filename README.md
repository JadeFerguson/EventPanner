# Event Panner
- Custom designed database made for an "event planner".
- This project was to design a database for a future or fake app.

## Project description
- My database is for the backend for a photography group, where photographers, models, designers, stylists, makeup artist, etc. This site/app would allow for the artists listed above to make an event where everyone has the information they need to help collaborate and know each other’s roles. It’s similar to that of Facebook events, where it shows the location, people involved, time start and end, roles of people, and a discussion where ideas can be shared amongst the collaborators. This event planner is to make scheduling easier for all collaborators involved so they don’t have to use Facebook, text, and their own calendar. This makes it so it’s all in one place. Although not all the tables are here, this is the most basic tables needed at the moment.
